'deserved 5*5*',negative
'Sorry, but i think Karim deserves at least the rating Salah and Mane got. I think he is the more talented and smarter on the pitch than them. Too much hype around the Preimer League only because of the way they market themselves',negative

Disappointing,negative
'He honestly toward the back half of the season hasn\'t been very good on the ball, and he just gave away another goal',negative
'Sad to see how his career is ending, used to be one of the best players in the premier league. Sold his soul and went for the P\'s',negative
'What is EA doing. I mean deserved rating but 3* weak foot? He\'s scored more goals with his weak foot than any other player in the premier league last season.',negative
'This rating is so stupid... Average player and had a super average season. No explanation whatsoever for this rating.',negative
'put Hunter on him and still unusuable..',negative

'You know it\'s bad when Serge Aurier getting an upgrade isn\'t even close to being the worst rating choice EA have made for FIFA 21',negative
'This man won the football writers player of the year award and came second in the PFA POTY award behind only KDB. Actually crazy that people think an 86 is too high for him. Fair enough if people think Thiago deserves higher than 85 I agree but donâ€™t take it out on Henderson. Such a bandwagon against Henderson itâ€™s ridiculous.',negative
'This stats an absolute joke',negative
'They make AgÃ¼ero bad because of his pace stat',negative
'Disrespect :\\',negative
'why non rare and whats with all these pace downgrades',negative
'I think a small pace downgrade is deserved. Don\'t get me wrong, he\'s very fast but not like 90+ pace. I would give him something like 91 acceleration and 87 sprint speed. So maybe 88-89 pace but never ever 82. Plus I think his overall should be 86.',negative

'Yo wtf, this dude deserves at least 86/87. ',negative
'PSG wins domestic quadruple and makes it to their first ever CL final... everyones downgraded....? just...',negative
'Give him a hunter chemistry style and that\'s it. I don\'t understand this rating either, but I would just deal with it the best way possible. His Shooting is good, he can take a hunter pace boost and everything\'s fine. With a hunter he has 95 positioning, 90 finishing, 99 acceleration and 86 sprint speed, that equals 93 pace',positive
'I think its a fair card. He\'s pace could be higher, maybe like 88 acceleration with 85 sprint speed. So maybe like 87 pace. The other stats are fine, of course 74 shooting or 81 passing seems not high enough but if you check his ingame stats its fair. 87 vision, 88 short passing, 83 positioning etc. ',positive
'Drgreenthumbb, It could be great with Joe Gomez or s/one higher than Thiago Silva cause this year probably will be back the aerial game',positive
'Should have more pace. And no I\'m not talking about that Dembele thing, cuz dembele was back from an injury. This guy can actually run really fast, but doesn\'t always necessarily need it!',negative
'done him dirty',negative

'had a breakout season and gets this, bruh',negative
'should be at least 80 rated',negative
'I genuinely dont get it how u can be this wrong with a rating. It obvius that he was our best defender last season and one of the best in europe. 84 Rating is not even close, even an 86 would ve been horribly wrong but this ****....this **** doenst make sense',negative

'no reason for this upgrade.',negative
'EA gave this guy a 93 overall card last year has he carried Leipzig... 79 seems deserving',negative
'derserved card but wtf ea how does he go from 60 pace to faster than gnabry and sancho',negative

'This man is one of the greatest CB\'s of all time... one of only 3 players to win PL player of the season twice (Henry and  being the others). Lukaku must be right, they are surely trying to generate attention, by outraging fans, with bad ratings. Either that or this is just more of what EA have done to United, Bayern and Arsenal this year. Tanking their player ratings, because they signed with PES. They really must have really ****ed off some people at EA, but surely an icon like Vidic get, who doesn\'t even play for United anymore, wouldn\'t be affected by that, would he?',positive

The game is getting fucked gradually. People will have dope squads so early on, there won’t be much left to improve. EA will have to come up with promotions very quickly.

Enjoy the discard pile, most piece of garbage player I’ve ever had. Single handedly cost me several weekend league games because I always subbed him in and despite him failing I always kept hope but now I’m just done. If you’re thinking about picking him or bloody Pickford to use as an attacking sub tell Jordan to lace up his boots because ASM will never be near my club again after consistently putting in the worst performances I’ve ever had the displeasure of watching in this shit show of a game that is fifa 21, aka fifa 20 version 2.0',negative
