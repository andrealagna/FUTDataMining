'when i tell you that the man is an animal,he has played 50 games for me and has 93 goals n 22 assits, the man is banging in nearly 2 a game or if he doesnt score in one game the next match he will definitely make up for it by bangin in 5 or 6, i think he has good strength he does cut in behind the defence and causes problems, he is turnin people inside out, my only thing that i find a problem is d 3* weak foot, sometimes he misses on his left peg but 95% of the time the man gets in to the right areas and he is a game changer my overall review9.2 out of 10',positive

'There aren’t enough words to describe how shit this guy is. Misses chances for fun, work rates are negative 1000, stands still while I wait to pass to him but he doesn’t go, and fails to do skill moves 99.9\% of the time despite the exact inputs working with the rest of my players. Enjoy the discard pile, most piece of garbage player I’ve ever had. Single handedly cost me several weekend league games because I always subbed him in and despite him failing I always kept hope but now I’m just done. If you’re thinking about picking him or bloody Pickford to use as an attacking sub tell Jordan to lace up his boots because ASM will never be near my club again after consistently putting in the worst performances I’ve ever had the displeasure of watching in this shit show of a game that is fifa 21, aka fifa 20 version 2.0',negative
